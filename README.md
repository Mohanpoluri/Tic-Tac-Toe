# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  The game allows two players to play on a 3x3 grid, highlights the winner,  and provides an option to restart the game.  This project is a beginner-friendly implementation of DOM manipulation,  event handling, and basic game logic in JavaScript.
